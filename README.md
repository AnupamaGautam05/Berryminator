# Berryminator (https://portal.e-yantra.org/themeIntro)

• Theme: Berryminator(https://portal.e-yantra.org/themeIntro). The theme established in a simulated environment to resemble indoor vertical
farming. The arena abstracted as a farm where different types of berries being cultivated in vertically stacked trays in different rooms. A robot
navigates through these rooms and galleries of the farm and harvest berries based on factors such as: size, ripeness and quantity required.
• Concepts used: Robotic Simulation, Image Processing, 3D Designing, Algorithm Building, Robot Navigation and localization, Python programming.
• Led a team of 4 students to develop a robotic machine that can sort and harvest berries.
• Task-1 aimed at Image Processing, Python Programming, and to provide an introduction to the CoppeliaSim Simulator.
• Task-2 aimed to detect berries and calculate their pose using OpenCV library and to design and simulate a robotic arm in CoppeliaSim.
• Task-3 aimed to design Navigation algorithm for the mobile robotic vehicle which carry the robotic arm designed by the team. Controlling and
navigating the vehicle in the scene and design an effective path planning algorithm for navigating the vehicle.
